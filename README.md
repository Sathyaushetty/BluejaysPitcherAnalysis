### Project Overview

This project involves analyzing the pitching performance of the Toronto Blue Jays using SQL queries on two datasets: LastPitchBluejays and BluejaysPitchingStats. The analysis is structured into four main questions, each addressing specific aspects of the team's pitching statistics.


### Data Sources

LastPitchBluejays.csv : This table contains data on the last pitches thrown by Blue Jays pitchers, including details like pitch number, pitch name, pitch location, batter position, and game context (home/away).
BluejaysPitchingStats.csv : This table includes overall pitching statistics for Blue Jays pitchers, such as innings pitched, pitch types, and player positions.


### Tools

- SQL Server - Data Analysis
- Excel - Data Cleaning



### Key Features of project

#### Comprehensive Pitching Analysis:
  1. The project provides an in-depth examination of Toronto Blue Jays pitchers' performance through various metrics, including average pitches per at-bat, home and away game comparisons, and performance against lefty and righty batters

#### Data Integration:
  1. Combines data from two different datasets (LastPitchBluejays and BluejaysPitchingStats) to enrich the analysis and provide a comprehensive overview of the pitching statistics.

#### Pitch Sequence and Strategy:
  1. Explores the sequence of pitches thrown in at-bats, identifying patterns and common strategies used by pitchers.

#### Customizable Queries:
  1. The SQL code is modular and can be adapted or extended to answer additional questions or delve deeper into specific areas of interest, such as comparing individual pitchers or analyzing specific game conditions.

#### Detailed Pitch Breakdown:
  1. Analyzes pitch types, frequencies, and their effectiveness, identifying the most common pitches and their outcomes in different game scenarios.

#### Home Run Insights:
  1. Investigates which pitches and pitch locations are most susceptible to home runs, breaking down data by pitch type, count, and pitcher role.

#### Performance Comparisons:
  1. Compares pitchers' performance based on game location (home vs away), batter stance (lefty vs righty), and pitcher role (starter, reliever, closer).

#### Advanced Statistical Techniques:
  1. Utilizes SQL's advanced functions like window functions, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), and conditional aggregation to provide nuanced insights into pitcher performance.

#### Chris Bassitt Specific Metrics:
  1. Focuses on pitcher Chris Bassitt, evaluating his average release speed, spin rate, strikeout rates, most commonly used pitch zones, and performance with runners on base.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, this project has been a comprehensive exploration of the Toronto Blue Jays' pitching performance. Through meticulous analysis and SQL querying, we've gained valuable insights into key aspects such as average pitches per at-bat, pitch type frequency and effectiveness, and home run susceptibility. Our findings offer a deeper understanding of the team's strategic choices and performance under different conditions, providing valuable information for decision-makers. By focusing on metrics like pitch effectiveness, individual pitcher performance, and specific game situations, we highlight areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. This analysis aids in optimizing game strategies and overall team performance, ensuring that the Toronto Blue Jays can make data-driven decisions to enhance their pitching tactics and achieve better outcomes in future games.
